YourCast is (open source and free) software that makes forecasts by
running sets of linear regressions together in a variety of
sophisticated ways. YourCast avoids the bias that results when
stacking datasets from separate cross-sections and assuming constant
parameters, and the inefficiency that results from running independent
regressions in each cross-section. The models enable you to have
different covariates, or the same covariates with different meanings,
in each cross-section.  You may choose from a wide variety of
smoothing techniques, such as assuming that the separate time series
regressions in neighboring (or "similar") countries are alike, based
on similarites in the <em>coefficients</em> (as in other approaches)
or in the values or trends in the <em>expected value of the dependent
variable</em>. This approach is advantageous because prior knowledge
almost always exists about the dependent variable, and the expected
value is always on the same metric even when including explanatory
variables that differ in number or meaning in each country. You can
also decide whether to smooth over indices that are geographic,
grouped continuous variables (such as age groups), time, or
interactions among these. For example, you can assume that, unless
contradicted by the data, forecasts should be relatively smooth over
time, or that the forecast time trends should be similar in adjacent
age groups, or even that the differences in time trends between
adjacent age groups stay roughly similar as they vary over countries.

<p>The model works with time-series-cross-sectional data but also data
for which the time series varies over more than one cross-section such
as log-mortality over time by age, country, sex, and cause. The
specific notion of "smoothness" or "similarity" used in YourCast
is also your choice. The assumptions made by the statistical model
are therefore governed your choices, and the sophistication of those
assumptions and the degree to which they match empirical reality are,
for the most part, limited only by what you may know or are willing to
assume rather than arbitrary choices embedded in a mathematical model.

<p>YourCast implements the methods introduced in Federico Girosi and
Gary King's book manuscript on <a
href="http://gking.harvard.edu/files/abs/smooth-abs.shtml"><em>Demographic
Forecasting</em></a>, Princeton University Press, forthcoming.  The
present version is for those familar with R (if you're not, see <a
href="http://gking.harvard.edu/zelig">Zelig</a>); the next version will have more extensive
preprocessing to make data input easier, and the version after that
will have a GUI so that knowledge of R is unnecessary.
